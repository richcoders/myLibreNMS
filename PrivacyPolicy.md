### Information I Collect

None, I really don't care.

### Services I use
 * Camera
 
 `myLibreNMS requests access to your Camera for the sole purpose of scanning the QR-Code generated by your Librenms instance so you don't have to type in a 1000 string for your api key. Use it, don't use. I don't care.
`
### Permissions

myLibreNMS is based off the open source project `LibreNMS` with permissions granted by the `LibreNMS` team to use any assets from the original project for `myLibreNMS`
